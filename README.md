  <h2> This is the apple pay case study description. This is an important example of how a leading tech company is moving into consumer finance in a big
way, using their existing iPhone/iPad/Mac platform and existing Apple Store relationships to gain market

second quarter of 2018, and more mobile transactions took place that quarter using Apple Pay than
PayPal.
