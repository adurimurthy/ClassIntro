  <h2> This is the apple pay case study description. This is an important example of how a leading tech company is moving into consumer finance in a big
way, using their existing iPhone/iPad/Mac platform and existing Apple Store relationships to gain market
share. And Apple Pay is hugely successful: well over a billion Apple Pay transactions took place in the
second quarter of 2018, and more mobile transactions took place that quarter using Apple Pay than
PayPal.

  <h4> Payment transactions are more secure due to the concept of Payment Tokenisation. The Payment Tokenisation Specification provides an interoperable Technical Framework that will benefit Acquirers, Merchants, Card Issuers, and Cardholders. This Technical Framework describes a global Payment Tokenisation ecosystem that overlays and interoperates with existing payment ecosystems to support digital commerce and new methods of payment.
